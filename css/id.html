<!-- id in css style tag starts with a hash (#) to differ from class -->
<style>

  #cat-photo-form {
    background-color: green;
  }
</style>
<!-- id has higher priority/specificity than class, 
and an id is usable to only one element so when we apply both id and class to one element, the id will be used instead of the class-->
